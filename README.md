# Flexo-Glove-for-Hand-Rehabilitation
The Flexo Glove is a portable, flexible, and waterproof hand rehabilitation device designed for users with hand disabilities. Unlike traditional pneumatic gloves, it uses Bluetooth to transfer physiotherapy instructions from a mobile app to the 3D-printed flexible glove. It tracks progress in real-time to aid hand recovery.
