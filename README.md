# Flexo-Glove-for-Hand-Rehabilitation
The Flexo Glove is an innovative solution designed for hand rehabilitation, specifically catering to individuals with hand disabilities. Unlike traditional pneumatic gloves, which require a gas cylinder and are often bulky and restrictive, the Flexo Glove is portable, flexible, and waterproof, offering a more user-friendly and versatile alternative.

Our glove leverages advanced technology to enhance the rehabilitation process for users with impaired hand functionality. It is designed to be worn comfortably and adjusts to the wearer’s hand movements, providing support and assistance as needed. This glove is equipped with sensors that allow for real-time data collection of the user’s hand movements.

A key feature of the Flexo Glove is its integration with a custom mobile app. The app uses Bluetooth technology to wirelessly transfer data from the glove to a connected device. This data is then processed to track the progress of the rehabilitation exercises, helping both users and healthcare providers monitor improvements over time.

The glove’s structure is based on a 3D-printed hand design, providing a precise and customizable fit for various users. This method also allows for easy adjustments and production of different sizes and shapes of the glove, making it more adaptable to individual needs. The combination of portability, flexibility, and cutting-edge data transfer technology makes the Flexo Glove a groundbreaking tool in hand rehabilitation.

By offering a practical, comfortable, and efficient solution for hand mobility restoration, the Flexo Glove has the potential to significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with hand disabilities, enabling them to regain strength, dexterity, and independence.
